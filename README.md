Welcome to the BlueWolfNinja wazuh-resources Github repo.

Here I maintain the authoritative versions of scripts and ruleset customizations I have authored to solve problems and meet needs I have faced while using the Wazuh SIEM solution over the past many years. 

Some of these resources I have co-authored with Ken Fredericksen, my chief partner in all things Wazuh.  You're the best, Ken!

In my blog site at https://bluewolfninja.com, I make reference to these resources.

Please let me know if you find them helpful, or have fixes or enhancements to suggest.

Thanks!\
